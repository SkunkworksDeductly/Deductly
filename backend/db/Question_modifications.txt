This presupposition is itself unprovable through archaeological evidence alone, since any attempt to verify it would require the very analogical reasoning it seeks to justify. Nevertheless, archaeological research continues to yield productive insights. This suggests that the validity of analogical reasoning in archaeology should be evaluated not by its theoretical foundations but by the coherence of the interpretive framework it produces.",
