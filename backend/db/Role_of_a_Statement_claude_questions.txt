This reasoning is flawed. Bacteria exposed to any antibiotic can develop resistance mechanisms that protect against structurally similar compounds—including those administered to humans. Furthermore, resistant bacteria readily transfer between animal and human populations through the food supply. The claim that livestock antibiotics differ from human medications thus provides false reassurance, obscuring rather than addressing the genuine threat that agricultural antibiotic practices pose to the efficacy of human medical treatments.",

The claim about cross-resistance mechanisms functions as a premise (a stated fact about bacterial biology) that attacks the reasoning of the public health officials by showing why their 'different antibiotics' premise fails to support their conclusion about minimal risk. It is not itself supported by other claims in the argument; rather, it is offered as a scientific fact that the author uses to dismantle the officials' reasoning.",

The author says the officials' reasoning is 'flawed' and then provides THIS claim as the reason why their premise (different antibiotics = no risk) doesn't work. The claim about resistance mechanisms is presented as a factual assertion about bacterial biology—it isn't supported by other explicit premises in this argument. It functions as evidence that directly attacks the officials' assumption that different antibiotics mean different (non-overlapping) resistance profiles.",
