Steps to get an Adaptive Study Plan Online
-------------------------------------------




1. Design Skill taxonomy
Hierarchy of Skills (LR, RC), and Subskills (flaw, causal reasoning, main point)



2. Define the Atomic Unit of curricula ("module")
A module is a bundle of some combination of videos + drills.
This method is superior to individual tasks, since we can model the implicit reward 
of a video through the general reward of a bundle, instead of defining a specific
reward function for a video (i.e. through engagement) as this would be too noisy.
This also reduces the sample space of actions from which to choose from.
