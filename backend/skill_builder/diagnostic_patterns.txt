=============================================================================
HOW TO USE THIS DOCUMENT
=============================================================================
This document provides a comprehensive framework for diagnosing student 
weaknesses based on performance patterns across LSAT LR question types.

For each diagnostic pattern:
  - TRIGGER: The failure pattern that initiates this diagnostic
  - CROSS-CHECK: Additional data points to confirm/refine diagnosis
  - ROOT CAUSE: The underlying skill deficiency
  - DIFFERENTIAL: How to distinguish from similar-looking issues
  - REMEDIATION: Targeted practice recommendations
  - EXPECTED IMPACT: Other question types that should improve

=============================================================================
PART I: STRUCTURAL DECOMPOSITION DIAGNOSTICS (S Domain)
=============================================================================

[DIAG-S01] MAIN CONCLUSION IDENTIFICATION FAILURE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
TRIGGER: 
  Student fails Main Point [3] consistently (>50% error rate)

CROSS-CHECK:
  - Role of Statement [13]: If also weak → S_01 is core issue
  - Strengthen/Weaken [5,6]: If weak → cascading effect confirmed
  - Necessary Assumption [8]: If weak → can't identify what to defend

ROOT CAUSE: S_01 (Main Conclusion ID)

DIFFERENTIAL:
  • If Role of Statement [13] is strong but Main Point [3] is weak:
    → Issue may be S_04 (confusing intermediate for main conclusion)
  • If student picks premises as conclusions:
    → Missing "indicator word" recognition training
  • If student picks background/context:
    → Missing argument boundary recognition

REMEDIATION:
  1. Drill conclusion indicator words (therefore, thus, hence, consequently)
  2. Practice "because test" - can each claim be preceded by "because"?
  3. Work backwards: what is the author trying to PROVE?

EXPECTED IMPACT: Improvements in [5], [6], [7], [8], [11], [12]

PRIORITY: ★★★★★ CRITICAL - Address before all other skills

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

[DIAG-S02] INTERMEDIATE CONCLUSION CONFUSION
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
TRIGGER:
  Student passes simple Main Point [3] but fails complex arguments with 
  nested structure, OR consistently picks intermediate conclusions on [3]

CROSS-CHECK:
  - Role of Statement [13]: If weak on "sub-conclusion" identifications
  - Method of Reasoning [12]: If struggles with "proceeds by using X to 
    support Y, which in turn supports Z" type answers

ROOT CAUSE: S_04 (Intermediate Conclusion Recognition)

DIFFERENTIAL:
  • If Main Point [3] errors are random (premises, background, etc.):
    → Issue is S_01 fundamentally, not S_04
  • If Main Point [3] errors are specifically intermediate conclusions:
    → Confirmed S_04 issue

REMEDIATION:
  1. Practice mapping multi-tier argument structures
  2. Identify claims that have BOTH supporting evidence AND downstream claims
  3. Ask: "Does this claim support something else?" If yes, it's not main.

EXPECTED IMPACT: Improvements in [3], [12], [13], [7], [8]

PRIORITY: ★★★★☆ HIGH

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

[DIAG-S03] DISAGREEMENT ISOLATION FAILURE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
TRIGGER:
  Student fails Point at Issue [4] consistently

CROSS-CHECK:
  - Main Point [3]: If weak → may not be isolating either speaker's claim
  - Answer patterns: Picking topics vs. actual disagreement points

ROOT CAUSE: S_03 (Disagreement Isolation)

DIFFERENTIAL:
  • If picking topics both speakers discuss but don't disagree on:
    → Missing "affirmation vs. denial" test application
  • If picking claims only ONE speaker addresses:
    → Not tracking both speakers systematically
  • If Main Point [3] is also weak:
    → S_01 deficiency is upstream cause; fix S_01 first

REMEDIATION:
  1. For each answer choice, explicitly test: Does A believe X? Does B deny X?
  2. Create two-column charts mapping each speaker's claims
  3. Eliminate answers where one speaker is silent or agrees

EXPECTED IMPACT: Direct improvement in [4] only (isolated skill)

PRIORITY: ★★★☆☆ MODERATE (isolated, low cross-question impact)

=============================================================================
PART II: FORMAL & DEDUCTIVE LOGIC DIAGNOSTICS (FL Domain)
=============================================================================

[DIAG-FL01] CORE CONDITIONAL LOGIC FAILURE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
TRIGGER:
  Student fails Must Be True [1] AND Sufficient Assumption [7] AND 
  Parallel Reasoning [14] (when conditional)

CROSS-CHECK:
  - Check specific conditional keywords: "if," "only if," "unless"
  - Check for contrapositive errors vs. translation errors
  - Do they pass non-conditional versions of same question types?

ROOT CAUSE: FL_01 (Conditional Translation) and/or FL_02 (Contrapositive)

DIFFERENTIAL:
  • If "if...then" questions are passed but "unless/only if" fail:
    → FL_01 is partial (keyword-specific gap)
  • If translation is correct but contrapositive is missed:
    → FL_02 specifically (knows A→B but misses ~B→~A)
  • If passing simple conditionals but failing chains:
    → Issue is FL_03, not FL_01/02

REMEDIATION:
  1. Systematic keyword training:
     - "If A then B" → A → B
     - "Only if B" → A → B (B is necessary)
     - "Unless B" → ~B → consequence
  2. Contrapositive drills: immediate reversal and negation
  3. Practice diagramming before solving

EXPECTED IMPACT: Improvements in [1], [7], [14], [16]

PRIORITY: ★★★★★ CRITICAL - Foundation for FL domain

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

[DIAG-FL02] CHAIN DEDUCTION FAILURE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
TRIGGER:
  Student passes simple conditional questions but fails when 3+ variables 
  must be linked (A→B→C→D type structures)

CROSS-CHECK:
  - Must Be True [1]: Fails on chained inference stimuli
  - Sufficient Assumption [7]: Fails when answer completes a chain
  - Parallel Reasoning [14]: Fails on longer conditional arguments

ROOT CAUSE: FL_03 (Chain/Transitive Deduction)

DIFFERENTIAL:
  • If failing on 2-variable conditionals:
    → Issue is FL_01/FL_02, not FL_03
  • If correctly identifying each link but missing the chain:
    → Working memory or systematic tracking issue
  • If contrapositive chains specifically fail:
    → FL_02 is weak, chains just expose it

REMEDIATION:
  1. Practice building conditional chains step-by-step
  2. Write out full chains before evaluating answer choices
  3. Train both forward (A→D) and backward (~D→~A) chain construction

EXPECTED IMPACT: Improvements in [1], [7], [14]

PRIORITY: ★★★★☆ HIGH

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

[DIAG-FL03] QUANTIFIER SCOPE CONFUSION
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
TRIGGER:
  Student fails Most Strongly Supported [2] with quantified stimuli, OR 
  makes "some→all" or "most→all" errors on Must Be True [1]

CROSS-CHECK:
  - Flaw [11]: If missing scope shift flaws
  - Resolve the Paradox [17]: If struggling with "some but not all" resolutions
  - Check answer patterns: Are they picking "stronger than warranted" choices?

ROOT CAUSE: FL_04 (Quantifier Scope) and/or FL_06 (Modal Precision)

DIFFERENTIAL:
  • If "all" vs "most" vs "some" distinctions are clear but "some" overlaps 
    are missed:
    → Issue is FL_05 (Quantifier Intersection) specifically
  • If "must" vs "could" vs "probably" distinctions are blurred:
    → FL_06 (Modal Precision) issue
  • If picking "all" when "most" is stated:
    → Pure FL_04 error

REMEDIATION:
  1. Drill quantifier definitions:
     - All = 100% | Most = >50% | Some = 1-100% | None = 0%
  2. Practice "scope ceiling" - answer cannot exceed stimulus scope
  3. Modal precision: Must = 100% | Likely = >50% | Could = >0%

EXPECTED IMPACT: Improvements in [1], [2], [11], [17]

PRIORITY: ★★★★☆ HIGH

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

[DIAG-FL04] QUANTIFIER INTERSECTION FAILURE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
TRIGGER:
  Student fails Must Be True [1] specifically on stimuli requiring overlap 
  deductions (e.g., "Most A are B" + "All B are C" → "Some A are C")

CROSS-CHECK:
  - Do they pass single-quantifier inferences?
  - Do they understand "most" + "most" = "some overlap" logic?

ROOT CAUSE: FL_05 (Quantifier Intersection)

DIFFERENTIAL:
  • If failing all quantifier questions:
    → Issue is FL_04, not specifically FL_05
  • If passing "all→some" inferences but failing "most→some":
    → FL_05 specifically, with "most" intersection gaps

REMEDIATION:
  1. Visual Venn diagram training
  2. Rules: "Most + Most = Some overlap" / "Most + All = Most"
  3. Practice with numerical examples (Most of 100 = 51+)

EXPECTED IMPACT: Improvements in [1], [2]

PRIORITY: ★★★☆☆ MODERATE

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

[DIAG-FL05] NECESSARY VS. SUFFICIENT CONFUSION
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
TRIGGER:
  Student shows these patterns:
  - On Necessary Assumption [8]: Picks "too strong" answers (sufficient)
  - On Sufficient Assumption [7]: Picks "too weak" answers (necessary)
  - On Flaw [11]: Misses "confuses necessary for sufficient" errors

CROSS-CHECK:
  - Analyze wrong answer patterns on [7] and [8]
  - Check Flaw [11] performance on conditional fallacy stimuli
  - Check if Strengthen [5] errors involve picking "guarantees" (too strong)

ROOT CAUSE: FL_07 (Conditional Fallacies / Converse-Inverse)

DIFFERENTIAL:
  • If only [8] shows "too strong" without [7] issues:
    → May be RH_04 gap detection issue, not FL_07
  • If [7] and [8] both show pattern:
    → Confirmed FL_07 - core distinction not understood
  • If Flaw [11] misses conditional fallacies specifically:
    → Confirms FL_07 affects flaw recognition too

REMEDIATION:
  1. Core distinction training:
     - Necessary: Required, but not enough alone (Nurse must pass test for 
       license, but test alone isn't sufficient)
     - Sufficient: Enough to guarantee, but not required (Winning lottery 
       guarantees wealth, but not required for wealth)
  2. Negation test practice for [8]
  3. "Does this 100% guarantee?" test for [7]

EXPECTED IMPACT: Improvements in [7], [8], [11]

PRIORITY: ★★★★★ CRITICAL - High-impact skill

=============================================================================
PART III: RHETORICAL & INDUCTIVE EVALUATION DIAGNOSTICS (RH Domain)
=============================================================================

[DIAG-RH01] CAUSALITY vs. CORRELATION CONFUSION
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
TRIGGER:
  Student fails Flaw [11] on causal argument stimuli, OR fails to identify 
  alternative explanations in Weaken [6]

CROSS-CHECK:
  - Weaken [6]: Are causal weakeners (alternatives) missed?
  - Strengthen [5]: Are "ruling out alternatives" strengtheners missed?
  - Evaluate [9]: If causal evaluation questions are weak
  - Resolve Paradox [17]: If missing explanatory mechanisms

ROOT CAUSE: RH_01 (Causality vs. Correlation) and RH_02 (Alternative Explanations)

DIFFERENTIAL:
  • If identifying "correlation cited" but not recognizing flaw:
    → RH_01 is partial - knows pattern but not critique
  • If picking "effect caused cause" (reverse causation):
    → RH_02 is weak; not considering all alternative types
  • If non-causal Strengthen/Weaken are fine:
    → Confirmed causal-specific issue

REMEDIATION:
  1. Causal attack training (3 types):
     - Alternative cause (Z caused both X and Y)
     - Reverse causation (Y caused X)
     - Coincidence (no causal link)
  2. Causal support training: ruling out alternatives
  3. Flag words: "led to," "caused," "resulted in," "due to"

EXPECTED IMPACT: Improvements in [5], [6], [9], [11], [17]

PRIORITY: ★★★★☆ HIGH - Very common flaw type

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

[DIAG-RH02] GAP ANALYSIS FAILURE (SUFFICIENCY)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
TRIGGER:
  Student fails Sufficient Assumption [7] AND Strengthen [5] together

CROSS-CHECK:
  - Principle Justify [10]: If also weak → confirmed RH_03 issue
  - Can student identify WHAT is missing between premises and conclusion?
  - Check if FL_03 is also weak (chain construction)

ROOT CAUSE: RH_03 (Sufficiency Gaps)

DIFFERENTIAL:
  • If [7] fails but [5] passes:
    → Issue may be FL_03 (chain-building), not gap identification
  • If [5] fails but [7] passes:
    → Issue is RH_07 (comparing partial support), not RH_03
  • If both fail with FL_03 strong:
    → Confirmed RH_03 - can't identify the gap itself

REMEDIATION:
  1. "What's missing?" training - explicit gap identification
  2. Practice: "If [gap filler] is true, does conclusion follow 100%?"
  3. Bridge-building: connect premise terms to conclusion terms

EXPECTED IMPACT: Improvements in [5], [7], [10]

PRIORITY: ★★★★★ CRITICAL

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

[DIAG-RH03] GAP ANALYSIS FAILURE (NECESSITY)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
TRIGGER:
  Student fails Necessary Assumption [8] AND Weaken [6] together

CROSS-CHECK:
  - Evaluate [9]: If weak on "what would determine validity" questions
  - Does student understand negation test?
  - Are they picking answers that COULD help but aren't REQUIRED?

ROOT CAUSE: RH_04 (Necessity Gaps)

DIFFERENTIAL:
  • If [8] fails with "too strong" answers:
    → See DIAG-FL05 (FL_07 issue instead)
  • If [6] fails but non-support questions pass:
    → General RH_04 weakness
  • If [6] fails on causal arguments specifically:
    → See DIAG-RH01 (RH_01/02 issue instead)

REMEDIATION:
  1. Negation test training: "If this is FALSE, does argument collapse?"
  2. Dependency identification: "What MUST be true for this to work?"
  3. Practice eliminating "nice to have" vs. "must have" answers

EXPECTED IMPACT: Improvements in [6], [8], [9]

PRIORITY: ★★★★★ CRITICAL

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

[DIAG-RH04] EVIDENTIAL WEIGHT COMPARISON FAILURE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
TRIGGER:
  Student passes Sufficient Assumption [7] and Necessary Assumption [8] 
  BUT fails Strengthen [5] and Most Strongly Supported [2]

CROSS-CHECK:
  - Are wrong answers "relevant but weaker support"?
  - Does student understand probabilistic vs. certain reasoning?
  - Evaluate [9]: Does student recognize "more vs. less helpful" data?

ROOT CAUSE: RH_07 (Evidential Weight Assessment)

DIFFERENTIAL:
  • If [5] fails with irrelevant answers:
    → Issue is gap identification (RH_03/04), not strength comparison
  • If [5] fails with "relevant but weaker" answers:
    → Confirmed RH_07 - can't compare evidential strength
  • If [2] specifically fails:
    → May also have FL_06 (modal precision) issue

REMEDIATION:
  1. Comparative evaluation training: "Which helps MORE?"
  2. Evidential strength hierarchy practice
  3. Always compare top 2-3 answers explicitly

EXPECTED IMPACT: Improvements in [2], [5], [9]

PRIORITY: ★★★★☆ HIGH

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

[DIAG-RH05] SAMPLING/EVIDENCE FLAW BLINDNESS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
TRIGGER:
  Student fails Flaw [11] on evidence-based flaws (surveys, studies, 
  generalizations)

CROSS-CHECK:
  - Are scope shift flaws also missed? (RH_08)
  - Does student recognize biased sample, small sample, unrepresentative 
    sample distinctions?

ROOT CAUSE: RH_05 (Sampling Validity)

DIFFERENTIAL:
  • If missing "sample too small":
    → Size recognition gap
  • If missing "sample biased/unrepresentative":
    → Selection bias recognition gap
  • If missing "survey wording" issues:
    → Methodology flaw recognition gap

REMEDIATION:
  1. Evidence critique checklist: Size? Selection? Methodology?
  2. Practice identifying generalizations in conclusions
  3. "Does the sample represent the conclusion population?" test

EXPECTED IMPACT: Improvements in [11]

PRIORITY: ★★★☆☆ MODERATE

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

[DIAG-RH06] SCOPE SHIFT BLINDNESS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
TRIGGER:
  Student fails Flaw [11] on scope-based flaws, OR fails Weaken [6] when 
  weakener targets scope overreach

CROSS-CHECK:
  - Common scope shifts: Some→All, Past→Future, Subgroup→Whole
  - Does student notice when conclusion is "broader" than evidence?
  - Quantifier questions (FL_04): if weak, may be related

ROOT CAUSE: RH_08 (Scope Shift Recognition)

DIFFERENTIAL:
  • If quantifier-specific scope (some/all) is missed:
    → May be FL_04/05 issue
  • If time-scope shifts (past→future) are missed:
    → Confirmed RH_08 (temporal scope specifically)
  • If group-scope shifts (subgroup→population) are missed:
    → Confirmed RH_08 (generalization scope)

REMEDIATION:
  1. Scope comparison training: premise scope vs. conclusion scope
  2. Flag common shifts: some→all, past→future, group→whole, absolute→relative
  3. Practice: "Does the evidence actually cover what the conclusion claims?"

EXPECTED IMPACT: Improvements in [6], [11]

PRIORITY: ★★★★☆ HIGH

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

[DIAG-RH07] AD HOMINEM / RELEVANCE FAILURE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
TRIGGER:
  Student fails Flaw [11] on relevance-based flaws (attacks on source, 
  motive, character rather than argument)

CROSS-CHECK:
  - Does student distinguish "argument about person" from "attack on logic"?
  - Are "appeal to authority" flaws also missed?

ROOT CAUSE: RH_06 (Ad Hominem / Source Attacks)

DIFFERENTIAL:
  • If student thinks personal attacks ARE valid weakeners:
    → Core RH_06 misunderstanding
  • If student identifies ad hominem but uses wrong abstract language:
    → ABS_02 matching issue, not RH_06

REMEDIATION:
  1. Relevance filter: "Does this attack the ARGUMENT or the PERSON?"
  2. Source vs. content distinction training
  3. Practice: "Even if true about the person, does it affect the logic?"

EXPECTED IMPACT: Improvements in [11]

PRIORITY: ★★★☆☆ MODERATE

=============================================================================
PART IV: SYSTEMIC ABSTRACTION DIAGNOSTICS (ABS Domain)
=============================================================================

[DIAG-ABS01] STRUCTURAL MATCHING FAILURE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
TRIGGER:
  Student fails Parallel Reasoning [14] BUT passes Must Be True [1] and 
  Sufficient Assumption [7]

CROSS-CHECK:
  - Is FL domain strong? If yes → abstraction is the issue
  - Can student describe argument structure in abstract terms?
  - Are they matching content rather than structure?

ROOT CAUSE: ABS_01 (Structural Matching)

DIFFERENTIAL:
  • If FL is weak:
    → Address FL first; parallel reasoning failure is downstream
  • If FL is strong but [14] fails:
    → Confirmed ABS_01 - can't strip content from arguments
  • If student finds matching structure but wrong conclusion polarity:
    → Need to verify conclusion type matching too

REMEDIATION:
  1. Variable substitution practice: A, B, C instead of actual terms
  2. Structure templates: "If A then B; A; therefore B"
  3. Content-stripping drills: identify structure ignoring subject matter

EXPECTED IMPACT: Improvements in [14]

PRIORITY: ★★★☆☆ MODERATE (but question type is time-consuming)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

[DIAG-ABS02] FLAW MATCHING FAILURE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
TRIGGER:
  Student identifies flaws correctly in Flaw [11] BUT fails Parallel Flaw [15]

CROSS-CHECK:
  - Can student name the flaw abstractly?
  - Are they finding the flaw but not the matching case?
  - Which flaw types cause matching errors specifically?

ROOT CAUSE: ABS_02 (Flaw Matching)

DIFFERENTIAL:
  • If Flaw [11] is also weak:
    → Address flaw recognition first (RH skills)
  • If Flaw [11] is strong but [15] fails:
    → Confirmed ABS_02 - can recognize but not match
  • If only certain flaw types cause [15] failure:
    → Flaw-specific matching gap

REMEDIATION:
  1. Flaw categorization training with abstract labels
  2. Practice: "Find another argument with the SAME error"
  3. Build flaw pattern library (causal flaw template, scope flaw template, etc.)

EXPECTED IMPACT: Improvements in [15]

PRIORITY: ★★★☆☆ MODERATE

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

[DIAG-ABS03] PRINCIPLE APPLICATION FAILURE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
TRIGGER:
  Student fails Principle Application [16] AND/OR Principle Justify [10]

CROSS-CHECK:
  - Is FL_01 strong? (Principles often conditional)
  - Can student extract the abstract rule from specific cases?
  - Direction confusion: [10] = find principle for case; [16] = find case for principle

ROOT CAUSE: ABS_03 (Principle Application)

DIFFERENTIAL:
  • If [10] fails but [16] passes:
    → Issue is principle extraction (abstraction direction)
  • If [16] fails but [10] passes:
    → Issue is principle application (concretization direction)
  • If both fail:
    → Confirmed ABS_03 - general principle reasoning gap

REMEDIATION:
  1. Bidirectional practice: extract principles AND apply principals
  2. Train conditional principle format: "If [condition], then [result]"
  3. Case-rule mapping exercises

EXPECTED IMPACT: Improvements in [10], [16]

PRIORITY: ★★★☆☆ MODERATE

=============================================================================
PART V: CROSS-DOMAIN DIAGNOSTIC PATTERNS
=============================================================================

[DIAG-CROSS01] PROVE FAMILY FAILURE (Family 1: [1], [2], [3], [4])
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
TRIGGER:
  Student fails multiple questions in the Prove family

DIAGNOSIS FLOW:
  1. Check Main Point [3]:
     - If weak → S_01 is foundational issue, address first
  2. Check Must Be True [1]:
     - If weak with conditionals → FL_01/02/03
     - If weak with quantifiers → FL_04/05/06
  3. Check Most Strongly Supported [2]:
     - If [1] strong but [2] weak → FL_06/RH_07 (probabilistic reasoning)
  4. Check Point at Issue [4]:
     - Largely isolated; test S_03 independently

PRIORITY ORDER: [3] → [1] → [2] → [4]

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

[DIAG-CROSS02] HELP/HURT FAMILY FAILURE (Family 2: [5]-[10])
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
TRIGGER:
  Student fails multiple questions in the Help/Hurt family

DIAGNOSIS FLOW:
  1. Check Main Point [3] first:
     - If weak → can't identify what to strengthen/weaken, fix S_01
  2. Check Sufficient Assumption [7] vs. Strengthen [5]:
     - If [7] strong, [5] weak → RH_07 (evidential weight)
     - If both weak → RH_03 (sufficiency gaps)
  3. Check Necessary Assumption [8] vs. Weaken [6]:
     - If [8] strong, [6] weak → RH_01/02 (causal) or general weakening skill
     - If both weak → RH_04 (necessity gaps)
  4. Check for SA/NA confusion:
     - If [7] and [8] show opposite error patterns → FL_07
  5. Check Evaluate [9]:
     - Integrates both strengthening and weakening → RH_07 with uncertainty

PRIORITY ORDER: [3] → [7]/[8] → [5]/[6] → [9] → [10]

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

[DIAG-CROSS03] STRUCTURE FAMILY FAILURE (Family 3: [11]-[16])
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
TRIGGER:
  Student fails multiple questions in the Structure family

DIAGNOSIS FLOW:
  1. Check Main Point [3] again:
     - Affects [11], [12] especially
  2. Check Flaw [11]:
     - Track which flaw TYPES are missed → maps to specific RH skills
  3. Check Method [12] vs. Role [13]:
     - Both weak → S_02 deficiency
     - [12] weak, [13] strong → ABS_01 (can't describe structure abstractly)
  4. Check Parallel Reasoning [14]:
     - If FL is strong but [14] fails → ABS_01
     - If FL is weak → address FL first
  5. Check Parallel Flaw [15]:
     - If [11] strong but [15] fails → ABS_02
     - If [11] weak → address flaw recognition first

PRIORITY ORDER: [3] → [11] → [12]/[13] → [14] → [15] → [16]

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

[DIAG-CROSS04] CONDITIONAL LOGIC SENSITIVITY CHECK
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
TRIGGER:
  Student shows inconsistent performance that varies by whether stimulus 
  contains conditional logic

DIAGNOSTIC TEST:
  Compare performance on:
  - Conditional vs. non-conditional Must Be True [1]
  - Conditional vs. causal Strengthen/Weaken [5]/[6]
  - Conditional vs. non-conditional Sufficient/Necessary Assumption [7]/[8]

IF CONDITIONAL VERSIONS CONSISTENTLY WORSE:
  → FL domain is the bottleneck; prioritize FL_01-03

IF NON-CONDITIONAL VERSIONS ALSO WEAK:
  → Issue is not FL-specific; check RH domain skills

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

[DIAG-CROSS05] CAUSAL REASONING SENSITIVITY CHECK
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
TRIGGER:
  Student shows inconsistent performance that varies by whether stimulus 
  contains causal reasoning

DIAGNOSTIC TEST:
  Compare performance on:
  - Causal vs. non-causal Strengthen [5]
  - Causal vs. non-causal Weaken [6]
  - Causal vs. non-causal Flaw [11]
  - Causal Evaluate [9] questions
  - Resolve Paradox [17] with causal mechanisms

IF CAUSAL VERSIONS CONSISTENTLY WORSE:
  → RH_01/RH_02 are the bottleneck; prioritize causal reasoning training

IF NON-CAUSAL VERSIONS ALSO WEAK:
  → General gap analysis skills (RH_03/RH_04) are the issue

=============================================================================
PART VI: SKILL PREREQUISITE CHAINS

These chains indicate remediation order when multiple skills are weak.
Address upstream skills before downstream skills.

CHAIN 1: STRUCTURAL FOUNDATION

CHAIN 2: CONDITIONAL LOGIC
  FL_01 → FL_02 → FL_03 → FL_07
  
  (Translation → Contrapositive → Chains → Fallacy Recognition)

CHAIN 3: QUANTIFIER LOGIC

  (Scope → Intersection → Modal Precision)

CHAIN 4: GAP ANALYSIS
  S_01 → RH_03/RH_04 → RH_07
  
  (Conclusion ID → Gap Detection → Evidential Comparison)

CHAIN 5: CAUSAL REASONING
  RH_01 → RH_02 → [Application in Strengthen/Weaken]
  
  (Recognize Causal Claims → Identify Alternatives → Apply to Questions)

CHAIN 6: ABSTRACTION
  [FL skills + RH skills] → ABS_01/ABS_02/ABS_03
  
  (Content skills must be solid before pure abstraction skills)
