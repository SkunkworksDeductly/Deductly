=============================================================================
HOW TO USE THIS DOCUMENT
=============================================================================
This document provides a comprehensive framework for diagnosing student 
weaknesses based on performance patterns across LSAT LR question types.

For each diagnostic pattern:
  - TRIGGER: The failure pattern that initiates this diagnostic
  - CROSS-CHECK: Additional data points to confirm/refine diagnosis
  - ROOT CAUSE: The underlying skill deficiency
  - DIFFERENTIAL: How to distinguish from similar-looking issues
  - TRAP ANALYSIS: Wrong answer patterns that reveal specific weaknesses
  - REMEDIATION: Targeted practice recommendations
  - EXPECTED IMPACT: Other question types that should improve

NEW IN V2: Distractor trap analysis has been integrated throughout. When a 
student selects a wrong answer, the TYPE of wrong answer reveals the specific 
skill gap. Use TRAP ANALYSIS sections to refine diagnoses.

PART I: STRUCTURAL DECOMPOSITION DIAGNOSTICS (S Domain)
=============================================================================

[DIAG-S01] MAIN CONCLUSION IDENTIFICATION FAILURE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
TRIGGER: 
  Student fails Main Point [3] consistently (>50% error rate)

CROSS-CHECK:
  - Role of Statement [13]: If also weak → S_01 is core issue
  - Strengthen/Weaken [5,6]: If weak → cascading effect confirmed
  - Necessary Assumption [8]: If weak → can't identify what to defend

ROOT CAUSE: S_01 (Main Conclusion ID)

DIFFERENTIAL:
  • If Role of Statement [13] is strong but Main Point [3] is weak:
    → Issue may be S_04 (confusing intermediate for main conclusion)
  • If student picks premises as conclusions:
    → Missing "indicator word" recognition training
  • If student picks background/context:
    → Missing argument boundary recognition

TRAP ANALYSIS (Main Point [3]):
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │ TRAP TYPE SELECTED              → INDICATES SKILL GAP                  │
  ├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
  │ Intermediate conclusion         → S_04 weakness (can't distinguish     │

  │                                                                         │
  │ Premise stated as conclusion    → S_01 core failure (doesn't           │

  │                                                                         │
  │ Background information          → S_02 weakness (role identification   │
  │                                   — can't isolate argument bounds)     │
  │                                                                         │
  │ Overly broad paraphrase         → Scope awareness gap — also affects   │

  │ Opposing view the author        → S_02 weakness — confusing            │
  │ argues against                    counterargument with conclusion      │
  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

REMEDIATION:
  1. Drill conclusion indicator words (therefore, thus, hence, consequently)
  2. Practice "because test" - can each claim be preceded by "because"?
  3. Work backwards: what is the author trying to PROVE?

EXPECTED IMPACT: Improvements in [5], [6], [7], [8], [11], [12]

PRIORITY: ★★★★★ CRITICAL - Address before all other skills

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

[DIAG-S02] INTERMEDIATE CONCLUSION CONFUSION
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
TRIGGER:
  Student passes simple Main Point [3] but fails complex arguments with 
  nested structure, OR consistently picks intermediate conclusions on [3]

CROSS-CHECK:
  - Role of Statement [13]: If weak on "sub-conclusion" identifications
  - Method of Reasoning [12]: If struggles with "proceeds by using X to 
    support Y, which in turn supports Z" type answers

ROOT CAUSE: S_04 (Intermediate Conclusion Recognition)

DIFFERENTIAL:
  • If Main Point [3] errors are random (premises, background, etc.):
    → Issue is S_01 fundamentally, not S_04
  • If Main Point [3] errors are specifically intermediate conclusions:
    → Confirmed S_04 issue

TRAP ANALYSIS (Main Point [3] — S_04-specific):
  When student CONSISTENTLY selects "intermediate conclusion" traps:
  • They CAN identify that a claim has support (so basic premise/conclusion 
    distinction exists)
  • They CANNOT identify that the claim also supports something else
  • This is a STRUCTURAL TRACKING issue, not a basic comprehension issue

  Diagnostic question: "Does this claim support something else in the passage?"
  • If student can answer correctly → S_04 training will help
  • If student cannot identify what supports what → S_01 may be upstream

REMEDIATION:
  1. Practice mapping multi-tier argument structures
  2. Identify claims that have BOTH supporting evidence AND downstream claims
  3. Ask: "Does this claim support something else?" If yes, it's not main.

EXPECTED IMPACT: Improvements in [3], [12], [13], [7], [8]

PRIORITY: ★★★★☆ HIGH

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

[DIAG-S03] DISAGREEMENT ISOLATION FAILURE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
TRIGGER:
  Student fails Point at Issue [4] consistently

CROSS-CHECK:
  - Main Point [3]: If weak → may not be isolating either speaker's claim
  - Answer patterns: Picking topics vs. actual disagreement points

ROOT CAUSE: S_03 (Disagreement Isolation)

DIFFERENTIAL:
  • If picking topics both speakers discuss but don't disagree on:
    → Missing "affirmation vs. denial" test application
  • If picking claims only ONE speaker addresses:
    → Not tracking both speakers systematically
  • If Main Point [3] is also weak:
    → S_01 deficiency is upstream cause; fix S_01 first

TRAP ANALYSIS (Point at Issue [4]):
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │ TRAP TYPE SELECTED              → INDICATES SKILL GAP                  │

  │                                                                         │

  │ Too broad — captures general    → Missing precision; S_01 may also     │
  │ dispute, not specific point       be weak                              │
  │                                                                         │
  │ Claim neither speaker           → Poor reading comprehension; not      │
  │ actually makes                    isolating actual claims              │
  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

REMEDIATION:
  1. For each answer choice, explicitly test: Does A believe X? Does B deny X?
  2. Create two-column charts mapping each speaker's claims
  3. Eliminate answers where one speaker is silent or agrees

EXPECTED IMPACT: Direct improvement in [4] only (isolated skill)

PRIORITY: ★★★☆☆ MODERATE (isolated, low cross-question impact)

[DIAG-FL01] CORE CONDITIONAL LOGIC FAILURE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
TRIGGER:
  Student fails Must Be True [1] AND Sufficient Assumption [7] AND 
  Parallel Reasoning [14] (when conditional)

CROSS-CHECK:
  - Check specific conditional keywords: "if," "only if," "unless"
  - Check for contrapositive errors vs. translation errors
  - Do they pass non-conditional versions of same question types?

ROOT CAUSE: FL_01 (Conditional Translation) and/or FL_02 (Contrapositive)

DIFFERENTIAL:
  • If "if...then" questions are passed but "unless/only if" fail:
    → FL_01 is partial (keyword-specific gap)
  • If translation is correct but contrapositive is missed:
    → FL_02 specifically (knows A→B but misses ~B→~A)
  • If passing simple conditionals but failing chains:
    → Issue is FL_03, not FL_01/02

[DIAG-FL02] CHAIN DEDUCTION FAILURE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
TRIGGER:
  Student passes simple conditional questions but fails when 3+ variables 
  must be linked (A→B→C→D type structures)

CROSS-CHECK:
  - Must Be True [1]: Fails on chained inference stimuli
  - Sufficient Assumption [7]: Fails when answer completes a chain
  - Parallel Reasoning [14]: Fails on longer conditional arguments

ROOT CAUSE: FL_03 (Chain/Transitive Deduction)

DIFFERENTIAL:
  • If failing on 2-variable conditionals:
    → Issue is FL_01/FL_02, not FL_03
  • If correctly identifying each link but missing the chain:
    → Working memory or systematic tracking issue
  • If contrapositive chains specifically fail:
    → FL_02 is weak, chains just expose it

REMEDIATION:
  1. Practice building conditional chains step-by-step
  2. Write out full chains before evaluating answer choices
  3. Train both forward (A→D) and backward (~D→~A) chain construction

[DIAG-FL03] QUANTIFIER SCOPE CONFUSION
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
TRIGGER:
  Student fails Most Strongly Supported [2] with quantified stimuli, OR 
  makes "some→all" or "most→all" errors on Must Be True [1]

CROSS-CHECK:
  - Flaw [11]: If missing scope shift flaws
  - Resolve the Paradox [17]: If struggling with "some but not all" resolutions
  - Check answer patterns: Are they picking "stronger than warranted" choices?

ROOT CAUSE: FL_04 (Quantifier Scope) and/or FL_06 (Modal Precision)

DIFFERENTIAL:
  • If "all" vs "most" vs "some" distinctions are clear but "some" overlaps 
    are missed:
    → Issue is FL_05 (Quantifier Intersection) specifically
  • If "must" vs "could" vs "probably" distinctions are blurred:
    → FL_06 (Modal Precision) issue
  • If picking "all" when "most" is stated:
    → Pure FL_04 error

[DIAG-FL04] QUANTIFIER INTERSECTION FAILURE

TRIGGER:
  Student fails Must Be True [1] specifically on stimuli requiring overlap 
  deductions (e.g., "Most A are B" + "All B are C" → "Some A are C")

CROSS-CHECK:
  - Do they pass single-quantifier inferences?
  - Do they understand "most" + "most" = "some overlap" logic?

ROOT CAUSE: FL_05 (Quantifier Intersection)

DIFFERENTIAL:
  • If failing all quantifier questions:
    → Issue is FL_04, not specifically FL_05
  • If passing "all→some" inferences but failing "most→some":
    → FL_05 specifically, with "most" intersection gaps

REMEDIATION:

[DIAG-FL05] NECESSARY VS. SUFFICIENT CONFUSION

TRIGGER:
  Student shows these patterns:
  - On Necessary Assumption [8]: Picks "too strong" answers (sufficient)
  - On Sufficient Assumption [7]: Picks "too weak" answers (necessary)
  - On Flaw [11]: Misses "confuses necessary for sufficient" errors

CROSS-CHECK:
  - Analyze wrong answer patterns on [7] and [8]
  - Check Flaw [11] performance on conditional fallacy stimuli
  - Check if Strengthen [5] errors involve picking "guarantees" (too strong)

ROOT CAUSE: FL_07 (Conditional Fallacies / Converse-Inverse)

DIFFERENTIAL:
  • If only [8] shows "too strong" without [7] issues:
    → May be RH_04 gap detection issue, not FL_07
  • If [7] and [8] both show pattern:
    → Confirmed FL_07 - core distinction not understood

     - Sufficient: Enough to guarantee, but not required (Winning lottery 
       guarantees wealth, but not required for wealth)

[DIAG-RH01] CAUSALITY vs. CORRELATION CONFUSION
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
TRIGGER:
  Student fails Flaw [11] on causal argument stimuli, OR fails to identify 
  alternative explanations in Weaken [6]

CROSS-CHECK:
  - Weaken [6]: Are causal weakeners (alternatives) missed?
  - Strengthen [5]: Are "ruling out alternatives" strengtheners missed?
  - Evaluate [9]: If causal evaluation questions are weak
  - Resolve Paradox [17]: If missing explanatory mechanisms

ROOT CAUSE: RH_01 (Causality vs. Correlation) and RH_02 (Alternative Explanations)

DIFFERENTIAL:
  • If identifying "correlation cited" but not recognizing flaw:
    → RH_01 is partial - knows pattern but not critique

CROSS-CHECK:
  - Evaluate [9]: If weak on "what would determine validity" questions
  - Does student understand negation test?

ROOT CAUSE: RH_04 (Necessity Gaps)

DIFFERENTIAL:
  • If [8] fails with "too strong" answers:
    → See DIAG-FL05 (FL_07 issue instead)
  • If [6] fails but non-support questions pass:
    → General RH_04 weakness

CROSS-CHECK:
  - Are wrong answers "relevant but weaker support"?
  - Does student understand probabilistic vs. certain reasoning?
  - Evaluate [9]: Does student recognize "more vs. less helpful" data?

ROOT CAUSE: RH_07 (Evidential Weight Assessment)

DIFFERENTIAL:
  • If [5] fails with irrelevant answers:
    → Issue is gap identification (RH_03/04), not strength comparison
  • If [5] fails with "relevant but weaker" answers:
    → Confirmed RH_07 - can't compare evidential strength
  • If [2] specifically fails:

  - Are scope shift flaws also missed? (RH_08)
  - Does student recognize biased sample, small sample, unrepresentative 
    sample distinctions?

ROOT CAUSE: RH_05 (Sampling Validity)

DIFFERENTIAL:
  • If missing "sample too small":
    → Size recognition gap
  • If missing "sample biased/unrepresentative":
    → Selection bias recognition gap
  • If missing "survey wording" issues:

CROSS-CHECK:
  - Common scope shifts: Some→All, Past→Future, Subgroup→Whole
  - Does student notice when conclusion is "broader" than evidence?
  - Quantifier questions (FL_04): if weak, may be related

ROOT CAUSE: RH_08 (Scope Shift Recognition)

DIFFERENTIAL:
  • If quantifier-specific scope (some/all) is missed:
    → May be FL_04/05 issue
  • If time-scope shifts (past→future) are missed:
    → Confirmed RH_08 (temporal scope specifically)

CROSS-CHECK:
  - Does student distinguish "argument about person" from "attack on logic"?
  - Are "appeal to authority" flaws also missed?

ROOT CAUSE: RH_06 (Ad Hominem / Source Attacks)

DIFFERENTIAL:
  • If student thinks personal attacks ARE valid weakeners:
    → Core RH_06 misunderstanding
  • If student identifies ad hominem but uses wrong abstract language:
    → ABS_02 matching issue, not RH_06

REMEDIATION:
  1. Relevance filter: "Does this attack the ARGUMENT or the PERSON?"

ROOT CAUSE: ABS_01 (Structural Matching)

DIFFERENTIAL:
  • If FL is weak:
    → Address FL first; parallel reasoning failure is downstream

PART VI: CROSS-PATTERN DIAGNOSTICS
=============================================================================

These diagnostics help identify underlying issues when multiple question 
types show weakness simultaneously.

[DIAG-CROSS01] THE "EVERYTHING IS WEAK" PATTERN
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
TRIGGER:
  Student shows weakness across 5+ question types with no clear pattern

DIAGNOSTIC PROTOCOL:
  1. Check Main Point [3] first
     - If weak → S_01 is foundational problem; address immediately
     - If strong → Continue to step 2
  2. Check Must Be True [1] + Sufficient Assumption [7]
     - Both weak → Check for conditional content
       - If conditional → FL_01/02/03 are bottleneck
       - If not conditional → General logical reasoning weakness
  3. If S_01 and FL basics are strong:
     - Issue may be test-taking skills, timing, or focus
     - Consider non-skill factors

PRIORITY: Always start with S_01, then FL_01/02

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

[DIAG-CROSS02] THE "PROVE vs. SUPPORT" PATTERN
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
TRIGGER:
  Student passes "certain" question types (Must Be True [1], Sufficient 
  Assumption [7]) but fails "probabilistic" types (Strengthen [5], Most 
  Strongly Supported [2])

ROOT CAUSE: RH_07 (Evidential Weight Assessment) + FL_06 (Modal Precision)

EXPLANATION:
  Student understands binary logic (guaranteed/not guaranteed) but struggles 
  with degree comparison (stronger/weaker support).

REMEDIATION:
  1. Comparative reasoning training: "Which helps MORE?"
  2. Probability intuition: not everything is 100% or 0%
  3. Elimination by comparison: hold two answers, pick stronger

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

[DIAG-CROSS03] THE "STRUCTURE vs. CONTENT" PATTERN
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
TRIGGER:
  Student passes content-based questions ([1], [5], [6], [7], [8]) but fails 
  structure-description questions ([12], [13], [14], [15])

ROOT CAUSE: ABS Domain weakness (ABS_01, ABS_02) and/or S_02

DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH:
  1. Check Method of Reasoning [12] and Role of Statement [13]:
     - Both weak → S_02 deficiency
     - [12] weak, [13] strong → ABS_01 (can't describe structure abstractly)
  2. Check Parallel Reasoning [14]:
     - If FL is strong but [14] fails → ABS_01
     - If FL is weak → address FL first
  3. Check Parallel Flaw [15]:
     - If [11] strong but [15] fails → ABS_02
     - If [11] weak → address flaw recognition first

PRIORITY ORDER: [3] → [11] → [12]/[13] → [14] → [15] → [16]

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

[DIAG-CROSS04] CONDITIONAL LOGIC SENSITIVITY CHECK
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
TRIGGER:
  Student shows inconsistent performance that varies by whether stimulus 
  contains conditional logic

DIAGNOSTIC TEST:
  Compare performance on:
  - Conditional vs. non-conditional Must Be True [1]
  - Conditional vs. causal Strengthen/Weaken [5]/[6]
  - Conditional vs. non-conditional Sufficient/Necessary Assumption [7]/[8]

IF CONDITIONAL VERSIONS CONSISTENTLY WORSE:
  → FL domain is the bottleneck; prioritize FL_01-03

IF NON-CONDITIONAL VERSIONS ALSO WEAK:
  → Issue is not FL-specific; check RH domain skills

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

[DIAG-CROSS05] CAUSAL REASONING SENSITIVITY CHECK
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
TRIGGER:
  Student shows inconsistent performance that varies by whether stimulus 
  contains causal reasoning

DIAGNOSTIC TEST:
  Compare performance on:
  - Causal vs. non-causal Strengthen [5]
  - Causal vs. non-causal Weaken [6]
  - Causal vs. non-causal Flaw [11]
  - Causal Evaluate [9] questions
  - Resolve Paradox [17] with causal mechanisms

IF CAUSAL VERSIONS CONSISTENTLY WORSE:
  → RH_01/RH_02 are the bottleneck; prioritize causal reasoning training

IF NON-CAUSAL VERSIONS ALSO WEAK:
  → General gap analysis skills (RH_03/RH_04) are the issue

METHOD OF REASONING [12]
  • Wrong method                 → S_02
  • Evaluates validity           → Method vs. Flaw confusion

  • Too generic                  → Structure vocabulary

ROLE OF STATEMENT [13]
  • Intermediate as main         → S_04
  • Premise as conclusion        → S_01
  • Adjacent text confusion      → Close reading

  • Impossible role              → Logical coherence

PARALLEL REASONING [14]
  • Same topic, diff structure   → ABS_01
  • Same conclusion type only    → Incomplete abstraction

PARALLEL FLAW [15]
  • Different flaw type          → ABS_02
  • Valid reasoning              → Content distraction
  • Similar surface only         → Deeper analysis needed
