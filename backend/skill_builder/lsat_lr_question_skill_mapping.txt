HOW TO READ THIS DOCUMENT
=============================================================================
For each question type:
  - PRIMARY SKILLS: The central cognitive demands (what the question tests)
  - SECONDARY SKILLS: Frequently required but not the focal point
  - DIAGNOSTIC NOTES: How to interpret success/failure on this question type

=============================================================================
FAMILY 1: THE PROVE FAMILY (Stimulus → Answer Choice)
=============================================================================

[1] MUST BE TRUE (INFERENCE)
    -------------------------
    Trigger: "Must be true," "Properly inferred," "Follows logically."
    Task: Deduce a claim guaranteed by the stimulus.
    
    PRIMARY SKILLS:
      - FL_03 Chain/Transitive Deduction
      - FL_05 Quantifier Intersection
      - FL_06 Modal Precision
    
    SECONDARY SKILLS:
      - FL_01 Conditional Translation
      - FL_02 Contrapositive Operations
      - FL_04 Quantifier Scope
    
    DIAGNOSTIC NOTES:
      - Pure deductive reasoning; tests formal logic skills
      - Failure here often indicates weak conditional logic foundation
      - If student passes Must Be True but fails MSS, the issue is 
        probabilistic vs. certain reasoning (FL_06, RH_07)

[2] MOST STRONGLY SUPPORTED (MSS)
    ------------------------------
    Trigger: "Most strongly supported," "Reasonably drawn."
    Task: Identify a claim highly likely to be true (95%+).
    
    PRIMARY SKILLS:
      - RH_07 Evidential Weight Assessment
      - FL_06 Modal Precision
    
    SECONDARY SKILLS:
      - FL_04 Quantifier Scope
      - FL_05 Quantifier Intersection
    
    DIAGNOSTIC NOTES:
      - Key distinction from Must Be True: allows probabilistic support
      - Tests ability to compare evidential strength across answer choices
      - Common error: selecting answer that's possible but not best supported

[3] MAIN POINT
    ----------
    Trigger: "Main conclusion," "Accurately expresses the conclusion."
    Task: Identify the author's final opinion/claim.
    
    PRIMARY SKILLS:
      - S_01 Main Conclusion ID
    
    SECONDARY SKILLS:
      - S_04 Intermediate Conclusion Recognition
      - S_02 Role Identification
    
    DIAGNOSTIC NOTES:
      - Foundational skill; failure here causes cascading problems
      - Common error: selecting intermediate conclusion or premise
      - If weak here, prioritize remediation before gap-analysis skills

[4] POINT AT ISSUE
    --------------
    Trigger: "Disagree over," "Point at issue."
    Task: Find the specific disagreement between two speakers.
    
    PRIMARY SKILLS:
      - S_03 Disagreement Isolation
    
    SECONDARY SKILLS:
      - S_01 Main Conclusion ID
    
    DIAGNOSTIC NOTES:
      - Requires identifying BOTH speakers' positions
      - Answer must be something Speaker A affirms AND Speaker B denies
      - Common error: selecting topic they discuss rather than point of conflict

=============================================================================
FAMILY 2: THE HELP/HURT FAMILY (Answer Choice → Stimulus)
=============================================================================

[5] STRENGTHEN
    ----------
    Trigger: "Strengthen," "Support," "Justify."
    Task: Make the conclusion more likely to be true.
    
    PRIMARY SKILLS:
      - RH_03 Sufficiency Gaps
      - RH_07 Evidential Weight Assessment
    
    SECONDARY SKILLS:
      - S_01 Main Conclusion ID
      - RH_01 Causality vs. Correlation
      - RH_02 Alternative Explanations
    
    DIAGNOSTIC NOTES:
      - Must identify the gap before finding what fills it
      - For causal arguments, ruling out alternatives strengthens
      - If student fails Strengthen but passes Sufficient Assumption,
        issue is likely RH_07 (comparing partial support)

[6] WEAKEN
    ------
    Trigger: "Weaken," "Undermine," "Call into question."
    Task: Make the conclusion less likely to be true.
    
    PRIMARY SKILLS:
      - RH_04 Necessity Gaps
      - RH_02 Alternative Explanations
    
    SECONDARY SKILLS:
      - S_01 Main Conclusion ID
      - RH_07 Evidential Weight Assessment
      - RH_08 Scope Shift Recognition
      - RH_01 Causality vs. Correlation
    
    DIAGNOSTIC NOTES:
      - Must identify what the argument depends on, then attack it
      - For causal arguments, introducing alternatives weakens
      - Common error: selecting answer that's negative but irrelevant

[7] SUFFICIENT ASSUMPTION (JUSTIFY)
    --------------------------------
    Trigger: "Follows logically IF assumed," "Properly drawn IF assumed."
    Task: Find the bridge that makes the conclusion 100% valid.

    PRIMARY SKILLS:
      - RH_03 Sufficiency Gaps
      - FL_03 Chain/Transitive Deduction

    SECONDARY SKILLS:
      - S_01 Main Conclusion ID
      - S_04 Intermediate Conclusion Recognition
      - FL_01 Conditional Translation
      - FL_02 Contrapositive Operations
      - FL_07 Conditional Fallacies (tested via trap elimination)

    DIAGNOSTIC NOTES:
      - Answer + Premises must GUARANTEE conclusion (100%)
      - Often requires building conditional chains
      - If student passes this but fails Strengthen, they understand
        validity but struggle with partial/probabilistic support
      - FL_07 trap: selecting necessary-but-not-sufficient answer
        (answer that's required but doesn't guarantee conclusion)

[8] NECESSARY ASSUMPTION
    --------------------
    Trigger: "Depends," "Required," "Assumes," "Relies."
    Task: Find the condition that MUST be true for the argument to exist.

    PRIMARY SKILLS:
      - RH_04 Necessity Gaps

    SECONDARY SKILLS:
      - S_01 Main Conclusion ID
      - S_04 Intermediate Conclusion Recognition
      - FL_01 Conditional Translation
      - FL_07 Conditional Fallacies (tested via trap elimination)

    DIAGNOSTIC NOTES:
      - Negation test: if negated answer destroys argument, it's necessary
      - Answer is required but may not be sufficient alone
      - FL_07 trap: selecting sufficient assumption (too strong)
        This is the converse error - confusing "guarantees" with "required"
      - If student consistently picks "too strong" answers, FL_07 is weak

[9] EVALUATE THE ARGUMENT
    ---------------------
    Trigger: "Most useful to know," "Helpful in evaluating."
    Task: Find the piece of data that determines validity.
    
    PRIMARY SKILLS:
      - RH_07 Evidential Weight Assessment
      - RH_01 Causality vs. Correlation
    
    SECONDARY SKILLS:
      - RH_03 Sufficiency Gaps
      - RH_04 Necessity Gaps
      - S_01 Main Conclusion ID
    
    DIAGNOSTIC NOTES:
      - Answer is typically phrased as a question
      - Correct answer: one version strengthens, other version weakens
      - Tests understanding of what information would resolve uncertainty

[10] PRINCIPLE (JUSTIFY)
     -------------------
     Trigger: "Which principle, if valid, justifies the reasoning?"
     Task: Identify a general rule that bridges the gap.
     
     PRIMARY SKILLS:
       - ABS_03 Principle Application
       - RH_03 Sufficiency Gaps
     
     SECONDARY SKILLS:
       - S_01 Main Conclusion ID
       - FL_01 Conditional Translation
     
     DIAGNOSTIC NOTES:
       - Like Sufficient Assumption but answer is a general principle
       - Principle must be abstract enough to apply beyond this case
       - Tests ability to identify underlying rule the argument assumes

FAMILY 3: THE STRUCTURE FAMILY (Abstract Analysis)
=============================================================================

[11] FLAW IN REASONING
     -----------------
     Trigger: "Flaw," "Vulnerable to criticism," "Error in reasoning."
     Task: Name the logical error.
     
     PRIMARY SKILLS (varies by flaw type):
       - RH_01 Causality vs. Correlation (causal flaws)
       - RH_02 Alternative Explanations (causal flaws)

       - ABS_02 Flaw Matching (for abstract answer choices)
     
     DIAGNOSTIC NOTES:
       - Specific primary skill depends on flaw type in stimulus
       - Abstract answer choices test ability to recognize flaw categories
       - Track which flaw types student misses to identify specific weakness

[12] METHOD OF REASONING
     -------------------
     Trigger: "Proceeds by," "Technique of argumentation."
     Task: Describe the argumentative strategy (whole argument).
     
     PRIMARY SKILLS:
       - S_01 Main Conclusion ID
       - ABS_01 Structural Matching
     
     SECONDARY SKILLS:
       - S_02 Role Identification
       - S_04 Intermediate Conclusion Recognition
     
     DIAGNOSTIC NOTES:
       - Tests ability to describe HOW argument works, not evaluate validity
       - Answer choices are abstract descriptions of argumentative moves
       - Common error: evaluating whether argument is good/bad

[13] ROLE OF A STATEMENT
     -------------------
     Trigger: "The claim that X plays which one of the following roles?"
     Task: Identify the function of a specific sentence.
     
     PRIMARY SKILLS:
       - S_02 Role Identification
       - S_04 Intermediate Conclusion Recognition
     
     SECONDARY SKILLS:
       - S_01 Main Conclusion ID
     
     DIAGNOSTIC NOTES:
       - Must determine if statement is: premise, intermediate conclusion,
         main conclusion, background, counterargument, or concession
       - Isolated skill; strong diagnostic value for structural understanding

[14] PARALLEL REASONING
     ------------------
     Trigger: "Pattern of reasoning," "Most similar to."
     Task: Match the valid logical structure.
     
     PRIMARY SKILLS:

     DIAGNOSTIC NOTES:
       - Must strip content and match abstract logical form
       - Time-intensive; often saved for last
       - Failure may indicate: weak formal logic OR weak abstraction ability
       - Test FL skills separately to disambiguate

[15] PARALLEL FLAW
     -------------
     Trigger: "Pattern of flawed reasoning," "Same error as."
     Task: Match the invalid logical structure.
     
     PRIMARY SKILLS:
       - ABS_02 Flaw Matching
       - [Specific flaw skill from stimulus: RH_01, RH_05, RH_08, etc.]
     
     SECONDARY SKILLS:
       - S_01 Main Conclusion ID
       - FL_01-03 (if conditional flaw)
     
     DIAGNOSTIC NOTES:
       - Two-step process: identify flaw type, then find matching flaw
       - If student identifies flaw correctly but picks wrong answer,
         issue is ABS_02 (matching), not flaw recognition
       - Track which flaw types cause matching errors

[16] PRINCIPLE (APPLICATION)
     -----------------------

     DIAGNOSTIC NOTES:
       - Given principle in stimulus; find case that matches in answers
       - Inverse of Principle Justify (10)
       - Often involves conditional logic (if X then Y)

FAMILY 4: THE DISCREPANCY FAMILY (Reconciliation)
=============================================================================

[17] RESOLVE THE PARADOX
     -------------------
     Trigger: "Resolve the apparent discrepancy," "Explain the conflict."

     PRIMARY SKILLS:
       - RH_02 Alternative Explanations
       - RH_07 Evidential Weight Assessment
     
     SECONDARY SKILLS:
       - FL_04 Quantifier Scope
       - S_01 Main Conclusion ID (if argument present)
     
     DIAGNOSTIC NOTES:
       - No argument to attack; just two facts that seem contradictory
       - Correct answer makes both facts simultaneously true
       - Common error: selecting answer that only addresses one fact

=============================================================================
DIAGNOSTIC PATTERNS
=============================================================================

IF STUDENT FAILS: Must Be True (1)
   CHECK: Other FL-heavy questions (7, 14)
   IF ALSO WEAK: Core formal logic deficiency (FL_01-03)
   IF STRONG ELSEWHERE: Issue is FL_05/FL_06 (quantifiers/modals)

IF STUDENT FAILS: Strengthen (5) AND Weaken (6)
   CHECK: Sufficient Assumption (7) and Necessary Assumption (8)
   IF ALSO WEAK: Core gap-analysis deficiency (RH_03, RH_04)
   IF STRONG ON 7/8: Issue is RH_07 (comparing partial support)

IF STUDENT FAILS: Flaw (11) AND Parallel Flaw (15)
   CHECK: Which flaw types are missed
   IF CONSISTENT TYPE: Specific flaw skill weakness (RH_01, RH_05, etc.)
   IF RANDOM: General flaw recognition weakness

IF STUDENT FAILS: Parallel Reasoning (14) BUT PASSES Must Be True (1)
   DIAGNOSIS: Issue is abstraction (ABS_01), not formal logic
   REMEDIATION: Practice stripping content from arguments

IF STUDENT FAILS: Main Point (3)
   PRIORITY: Address immediately; affects all other question types
   CHECK: Role of Statement (13) to isolate S_01 vs S_04

IF STUDENT FAILS: Sufficient Assumption (7) AND/OR Necessary Assumption (8)
   CHECK: Answer choice patterns on missed questions
   IF PICKING "TOO STRONG" ON NA: FL_07 weakness (confusing sufficient for necessary)
   IF PICKING "TOO WEAK" ON SA: FL_07 weakness (confusing necessary for sufficient)
   IF BOTH PATTERNS: Core necessary/sufficient distinction not understood
   CROSS-CHECK: Flaw questions (11) involving conditional fallacies
   NOTE: FL_07 can be diagnosed via SA/NA trap patterns even without Flaw questions
