# LSAT LOGICAL REASONING SKILL TAXONOMY (FINAL v2.1)
# Designed for Q-Matrix Construction and Competency Analysis

=============================================================================
DOMAIN I: STRUCTURAL DECOMPOSITION (Parsing & Syntax)
Focus: Navigating complex syntax and identifying functional roles.
=============================================================================
[S_01] Main Conclusion ID
       - Definition: Distinguishing the final claim from intermediate conclusions.
       - Trigger: "Main point," "Conclusion."

[S_02] Role Identification
       - Definition: Identifying the rhetorical function of a specific sentence.
       - Trigger: "The statement that... plays which one of the following roles?"

[S_03] Disagreement Isolation
       - Definition: Pinpointing the exact proposition where two speakers differ.
       - Trigger: "Point at issue," "Disagree over."

[S_04] Intermediate Conclusion Recognition
       - Definition: Identifying claims that are both supported by premises AND used to support further conclusions.
       - Trigger: Nested indicators (e.g., "Therefore" appearing before the final sentence).

=============================================================================
DOMAIN II: FORMAL & DEDUCTIVE LOGIC (The "Games" Replacement)
Focus: Manipulating symbols, rules, and mathematical scope with certainty.
=============================================================================
[FL_01] Conditional Translation
        - Definition: Converting text (unless, only if) into symbolic notation (A -> B).

[FL_02] Contrapositive Operations
        - Definition: Recognizing that A -> B is logically identical to ~B -> ~A.

[FL_03] Chain/Transitive Deduction
        - Definition: Linking variables across statements (A -> B -> C, therefore A -> C).

[FL_04] Quantifier Scope
        - Definition: Distinguishing force: All (100%), Most (>50%), Some (1-100%), None (0%).

[FL_05] Quantifier Intersection
        - Definition: Deducing overlaps (e.g., If Most A are B, and All B are C -> Some A are C).

[FL_06] Modal Precision
        - Definition: Distinguishing between Must, Likely, and Could.

[FL_07] Conditional Fallacies (Converse/Inverse)
        - Definition: Recognizing the error of reversing (B -> A) or negating (~A -> ~B) without a biconditional relationship.
        - Trigger: "Confuses a necessary condition for a sufficient condition."

=============================================================================
DOMAIN III: RHETORICAL & INDUCTIVE EVALUATION (The "Gap")
Focus: Assessing the validity of arguments and identifying flaws.
=============================================================================
[RH_01] Causality vs. Correlation
        - Definition: Identifying the flaw of assuming causation based on occurrence.

[RH_02] Alternative Explanations
        - Definition: Recognizing a third factor (Z) or reversal (Y caused X).

[RH_03] Sufficiency Gaps (Forward Bridge)
        - Definition: Identifying a premise that guarantees the conclusion (100% valid).

[RH_04] Necessity Gaps (Backward Requirement)
        - Definition: Identifying a condition required for the argument to survive.

[RH_05] Sampling Validity
        - Definition: Critiquing the representativeness or size of a sample/survey.

[RH_06] Ad Hominem / Source Attacks
        - Definition: Distinguishing attacks on character/motive from attacks on logic.

[RH_07] Evidential Weight Assessment
        - Definition: Comparing how strongly different pieces of evidence support a claim.
        - Trigger: "Most strongly supported," "Strengthen" (comparative choices).

[RH_08] Scope Shift Recognition
        - Definition: Identifying when a conclusion's scope exceeds the evidence (e.g., "Some" to "All", "Past" to "Future").

=============================================================================
DOMAIN IV: SYSTEMIC ABSTRACTION (Pattern Recognition)
Focus: Stripping away content to analyze the logical skeleton.
=============================================================================
[ABS_01] Structural Matching
         - Definition: Matching valid logical structure to a new scenario (Parallel Reasoning).

[ABS_02] Flaw Matching
         - Definition: Matching a specific logical error to a new scenario (Parallel Flaw).

[ABS_03] Principle Application
         - Definition: Applying a broad rule to a specific factual case.
